<h2>My top three movies of the year</h2>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Think Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmaron. Except there's no horse and it's completely different.</p>
<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<p>A riveting rom-com about the dangers of dating heavy machinery.</p>
<h3>Hello, Dolly!</h3>
<p>Some things are just classics, baby.</p>
