    <h1>Vibes</h1>
        <h2>I fancy myself a rulebreaker</h2>
            <p>I am a writer by trade, a marketer and strategist by fortunate accident*. I’m a nerd for linguistic techniques, a lover of idioms, a member of the Oxford comma camp, and a devout disciple of Ferdinand de Saussure’s theory that language is two-sided: langue, the formal layer, and parole, the way we speak in real life. I honor the first. I root my work in the second. </p>
            <p>*roughly 30,000(?) hours of: trial-and-error, making mistakes, trying again, tracking results, studying human behavior (actual psychology courses), dissecting successful content, learning how to analyze and apply data, and discovering how the right content can bridge critical gaps for any brand.</p>
            <p>I’m a seasoned content directer with a passion for creative storytelling, and a strong track record scaling content departments for high-growth agencies. I’ve helmed the creation and execution of brand frameworks, multi-channel strategies, and meaningful campaigns for Series A startups to $100M brands across a diverse set of industries, with a soft spot for scrappy underdogs in CPG and consumer tech. </p>
            <p>In this next phase of my career, I want to take a groundbreaking brand and put them on the map. I want to flex my content chops to attract an audience, generate a following, and create a pipeline of I-want-this-now-let-me-have-it-now buyers, you-will-absolutely-be-my-choice-when-I’m-ready future customers, and I-just-love-this-brand-so-I-share-everything-they-do referrers. </p>
            <p>I believe original, *distinctly human* content is the future of marketing. I believe AI should be used to make content better, not to mass-produce generic content that blends into the crowd. I believe brand trust is the new ROI. And I believe creative capital is the new ‘next round of funding.’</p>
            <p>I want to find a home with a brand that believes it, too. </p>
            <p>If you’re on the edge of your seat after reading this, hopefully that means it’s time for an interview. </p>
            <p>Best, <br />Bridget Dougherty</p>
